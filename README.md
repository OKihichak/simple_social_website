## 🔑 API Key Management
Since the project doesn't directly involve external APIs requiring keys, standard Django secret management practices should be followed:
- Keep the `SECRET_KEY` in the `settings.py` file secure.
- Consider using environment variables or Django's `django-environ` package for managing sensitive information in production.
